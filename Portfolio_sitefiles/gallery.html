            </div>
            <p>Without a doubt my favorite game of all time. Pikmin 2’s incredibly unique gameplay mechanics, memorable level and environmental design, rich and adaptive soundtrack, and of course the awesome characters of the captains and the pikmin are just too much fun. This game has so much soul and character, and the gameplay loop of growing your pikmin horde, fighting enemies, and collecting treasures is simple but effective. While Pikmin 3 and 4 are perhaps more refined, and certainly more pretty games, Pikmin 2 has an undeniable personality that I feel the later games lack to a degree. Certainly a masterpiece.</p>

            <p>This game sparked my passion for marine biology and is one of the most memorable experiences on the Wii. Endless Ocean: Blue World is an adventure game where the player explores marine environments throughout the world. Finding new fish species, searching for treasure, and unraveling the story threads are a relaxing and simply a joy, with a few moments of tension sprinkled in to keep you on your toes. The environments are where this game excels, each one entirely unique, vast, and detailed, especially for the Wii. There are so many little things to collect and look at, with hundreds of marine species present in their native environments. The soundtrack, composed by Celtic Woman, supports these environments so well. Even the 40 second ambience tracks are baked into my memory. I have yet to play a game that better evokes the feeling of exploring something new, even upon replaying the game for the 20th time.</p>

            <p>When discussing truly iconic masterpieces, Super Mario Galaxy is that game for Wii-era Nintendo. This game in all facets is truly unforgettable. Beautiful level design, countless new ideas in mechanics, and a masterclass of an orchestral soundtrack make this game truly grand. The level of creativity for this game is unmatched, and few games evoke the feeling of the vastness of space so well. Of the 3D Mario games, this stands as my favorite.</p>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>The final game of the Dark Souls trilogy. The sheer depth of this games mechanics is staggering. There is so much to be explored with how you build your character, and every boss will test your character in engaging and, of course, difficult ways. Working your way through this game for the first time is like nothing else, and while it can feel like smashing your head against a brick wall, once that wall is broken through there is no feeling like it. This game manages to ride the line of being extremely challenging while still providing enough avenues for a sufficiently skilled player to overcome the challenge. Going back through the game after beating it before is also incredibly rewarding, as you find yourself being able to beat the bosses much easier now that you’ve gained enough skill and knowledge to defeat them. Such a fun game.</p>

            <p>Team Fortress 2 is the first modern hero-shooters, and no other hero-shooter has come close to the quality of this game in over 15 years of its release. Each of the nine classes serve a distinct role in every battle, each with strengths and weaknesses to cover or exploit the weaknesses of the other classes. Each of these 9 characters are actually developed as just that, characters, with real personality behind them. Expertly voice-acted and animated, every TF2 mercenary is memorable in their own right. Its timeless visual style and impeccable map design make the game last, and the depth in its gameplay is like no other first person shooter. Every match of Team Fortress 2 will develop in an entirely unique way, and every time I play it I find myself smiling at the sheer quality of a multiplayer team-based experience, something that no game in its genre can produce on a consistent basis.</p>
