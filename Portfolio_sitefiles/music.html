            <p>OK Computer, Radiohead's third album, is an examination on the growing pains of a society undergoing a new technological growth. The album touches on several themes: slowly growing insanity and mental instability, the feelings of loneliness and being lost, and criticizing modern politics. These themes are all reinforced by the balance of both aggressive and soft tones throughout the album, certain songs leaning more heavily into certain aspects of this composition. Songs like Paranoid Android, Let Down, and Climbing Up the Walls feed more into the mental struggles of the late 20th century, while Airbag and Lucky are more of a peek behind the curtain into Thom Yorke’s life experiences. Truly a beautifully composed album, with a level of attention to detail and raw emotion that make it a timeless masterpiece.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Airbag</h3>
            <br>
            <p>To begin the album, Airbag establishes much of the sound composition of the album. The wailing lead guitar and the echoed floatiness of the song is constant throughout, which pair well with Thom Yorke’s strained yet soft voice and the slightly compressed drums. Each song has a unique twist on this generally consistent composition, Airbag’s being the constant jingle bells and backup vocals after the second chorus, giving the song a cold, wintry feel. Lyrically the song discusses the feeling one feels after having a near-death experience. Yorke had been involved in a car crash a decade before and was saved by the car’s airbag. The feeling is described as almost superhuman, “In an interstellar burst, I am back to save the universe.” The song manages to juggle the cold nature of death as well as the hopeful nature of surviving such an event in its sound.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Paranoid Android</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Paranoid Android is perhaps the most complex song on the album with three distinct parts. The first 2 verses are about a narcissistic insanity festering within a person, who wants nothing more than to lash out against those who speak against them. The aggressive lead guitar riffs and droning bass amplify this boiling feeling. The song reaches a climax in the first bridge, Yorke is shouting and wailing the lyrics, “You don’t remember! You don’t remember! Why don’t you remember my name?” The raw emotion comes through his voice so well it’s almost jarring on the first couple listens of the song. This bridge comes to a close quickly, then feeds into the remainder of the song, more slow, soft, and floaty. Almost a palette cleanser, a distinct shift from the previous parts, I think this section is about the catharsis felt after a severely stressful event. The song as a whole, I believe, is the complete cycle of a mental breakdown. The slow buildup of rage and ire towards others, then the explosive outburst, followed by the solemn recovery. Very interesting song, the only one on the album with 3 distinct parts like this. Certainly, one of my favorites. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Subterranean Homesick Alien</h3>
            <br>
            <p>I am a sucker for the sci-fi sound in music. The soundscape in this song is effectively tooled to sound otherworldly, which obviously suits the nature of the song. The lyrics of this one discuss feeling jaded with the monotony of human life, wishing aliens would come to Earth to take the protagonist and “Show me the world as I'd love to see it.” The song also criticizes humanity, discussing how we now live in ways that are untrue to ourselves, keep secrets from others, and harm ourselves with drugs, hate, and stupidity. This feeling of wanting to escape the rest of humanity is and was common of people who grew up in the 90s/early 00s, and this song does a great job of encapsulating that.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Exit Music (For A Film)</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Written for the closing credits of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliett (1996). The song talks about two people, in love, attempting to escape from an oppressive father figure. There is an allusion to death throughout, as in Romeo and Juliett the pair take their own lives as they cannot be together in life. This song carries that heavy emotion extremely well, slowly building up to the climax in the 5th verse. Similarly to Paranoid Android, the peak of emotion is felt in Yorke’s singing, but this time much more controlled and solemn. The lyric at this apex, “Now we are one in everlasting peace” is indicative of the characters’ belief that they will be better off with each other in death than in life. Romeo and Juliett is a cornerstone of tragedy in Western culture, and this song carries that torch forward in song very beautifully.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Let Down</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Let Down discusses how often the routine modern life can leave one feeling crushed, never finding true gratification in the things they do or the things they want. This denial of satisfaction however eventually manifests into a feeling of hope. Hope that, “One day I am gonna grow wings,” from being “Crushed like a bug in the ground.” The lead guitar and bass are playing a more uplifting sound than much of the previous songs, and Let Down is one of the few on the album with a shred of optimism. Perhaps that is why this song speaks to me the most. I am someone who believes in my own ability to recover from any difficult situation, and that only through struggle can true growth and evolution be made. You cannot have the highs without the lows, and this song encapsulates that perfectly. A personal favorite.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Karma Police</h3>
            <br>
            <p>This song is all about judgement, perceived justice, and of course, the concept of Karma. In Hinduism, every action a person does has consequences, what those consequences are (good or bad, severity, etc.) are determined by the action. Essentially, if you do bad things, expect bad things to happen to you in return. The first two verses are the protagonist calling upon the ‘Karma police’ to serve justice to two people that they simply do not get along with for various reasons. The outro, however, circles back to these accusations, “For a minute there, I lost myself,” repeated multiple times. Perhaps the protagonist realizes that they are not one to be casting judgement on these people, as Karma will take care of that on its own. Judgement and drawing quick conclusions are constant in modern society, and perhaps partaking in that vicious mindset only serves to do harm. Very interesting song narratively speaking. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Fitter Happier</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Fitter Happier isn’t a song, more akin to a skit from a hip-hop album than anything, simply a robotic text-to-speech voice reading off several lines. It’s almost a how-to of the most efficient way of living in modern society. Guarding emotions, limiting connections with others, doing what’s ethically right but only in a pragmatic way. The robotic voice reinforces the theme of feeling like an android, a drone serving as a cog in a system, rather than a true independent human. This is touched on throughout the album, and this skit emphasizes the ideals that modern society has pushed onto us.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Electioneering</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Electioneering is more familiar to a lot of other English indie rock, criticizing politicians, economic policy, and international diplomacy. The song mocks how political candidates will often appeal to voters through promising change and economic opportunity, but then just become a part of the system themselves, and the cycle continues forever. The aggressive twanginess of the lead guitar and of Yorke’s vocals showcase how politicians will fight tooth and nail for votes, and often lose themselves in the process. “I will stop, I will stop at nothing.”</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Climbing Up the Walls</h3>
            <br>
            <p>A much more muddy and dense soundscape for this song. This song is about a persistent paranoia, personified as a voice in one’s head. Yorke’s voice is highly compressed and reverbed, making it seem more detached than the rest of the tracks. The composition is reminiscent of horror movies, with eerie chimes and strained strings. This song emulates the feeling of having a second voice trapped in your head, one that’s constantly feeding your fears and insecurities. This is another on the album that leans more into the mental decay theme of the album.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>No Surprises</h3>
            <br>
            <p>This song, like Subterranean Homesick Alien, is about being apathetic towards a routine lifestyle, a lifestyle that is so cyclical and draining that the persona contemplates suicide as an alternative. “I’ll take a quiet life, A handshake of carbon monoxide, And no alarms and no surprises.” (The no alarms in reference to not wanting a carbon monoxide detector to go off and wake them before they suffocate) This contrasts Exit Music interestingly, as they both deal with suicide. Exit Music is full of emotion, with swelling and grand composition, while No Surprises is sung in a monotone voice, devoid of emotion, with a peaceful lullaby-like tune played throughout. Love versus apathy. The lullaby sound could also be a desire to return to a child-like state, carefree with no responsibility, and not having the weight of a job and past trauma on one’s shoulders.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Lucky</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Back to the theme of love, Lucky is about someone who has a dependent relationship with a girl named Sarah, a relationship that is both a burden and necessary for the other to continue on. The chorus, “Pull me out of the aircrash, pull me out of the lake, ‘Cause I’m your superhero, we are standing on the edge,” spells it out pretty clearly. Both parts of this relationship are necessary for the other to exist. This love given to the persona by Sarah makes him feel whole, like a superhero, and he feels lucky to have it, and without it, he would be a shell of himself.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>The Tourist</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Rounding out the tracklist, we come to The Tourist, a song about a person who travels so much, experiences things so quickly, that they are breaking down. The first verse is an interaction between the tourist and their dog, “It barks at no one else but me, like it’s seen a ghost, I guess it’s seen the sparks a-flowin.” The tourist travels so much that their own dog doesn’t recognize them, but can sense an unwellness within them. Again there’s references to the robotic nature of modern people with the sparks. The chorus repeats the phrase “slow down” over and over again, this is likely a reflective statement from the tourist, saying that they need to slow down their life in order to reach a happier state. It could also be a cyclical reference to the very first song, Airbag, which talks about a car crash. It is always a bit eerie when this song comes on when I’m driving, I make sure to heed its advice.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Closing Summary and Rating</h3>
            <br>
            <p>This album, simply put, is a masterpiece. It manages to juggle multiple themes and ideas and present them throughout the album yet each song is so unique in its composition, lyricism, and structure. I believe the album is the best at capturing the mentality of the Millennial generation: apathetic, cynical, and self-destructive, and is a true testament to the era that it was created in, while remaining timeless in its quality. These themes still pervade today, and as my generation is entering the workforce and establishing itself in the world, we too must figure out how to navigate an often callous world. We tend to be more optimistic, so perhaps we can shed the shackles of some of the pressures and social norms described in this album that only serve to damage us mentally. 5/5, my favorite album of 2024, and likely will remain a top pick for me for a long time. </p>
